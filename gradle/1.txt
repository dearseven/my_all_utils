1.Declaring custom 'clean' task when using the standard Gradle lifecycle plugins is not allowed.
一般出现这个问题是因为重写了clean任务
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.3.1'

        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}

plugins {
    id "com.jfrog.bintray" version "1.7.3"
    id "com.github.dcendents.android-maven" version "1.5"
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}

task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
解决方案
You should not try to override the default clean task, but instead configure it to delete additional stuff like

clean {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}

But check first whether this is not the default behavior of the clean task anyway.
Alternatively if you want to be able to do a specific clean action individually, you can also define a separate task and add a dependency like

task customClean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
clean.dependsOn customClean
